## Source Style

### JavaScript Style
* Use soft-tabs (spaces) with a two space indent.
* Do your best to never use a semicolon. This means avoiding them at line breaks and avoiding multi-statement lines. For more info, read Mislav MarohniÄ‡'s ["Semicolons in JavaScript are optional"](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/).
